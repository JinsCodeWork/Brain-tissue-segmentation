# Brain-tissue-segmentation
Classical  and deep learning approaches for segmenting of different tissue types in MRI scans of the Brain

Segmentation of different tissues from MRI scans of the brain is an important step for further downstream applications such as disease prediction, classification or brain age estimation.

The goal of the project is to implement classical and deep learning approaches for segmentation of different tissue types in MRI scans of the brain, i.e., background, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM). We provide data from a total of 652 healthy subjects, that is split into different development sets and a hold-out test set.
